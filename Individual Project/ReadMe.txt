To use the program you will need to specify the file you want 
to read in the flightRoughting Class file on the 56th line within 
the FileReader constructor. 

If the file name put in is not enabling the code to run, kindly put the
whole path of where the file is located as the ide may be operating in a
specific working directory different from where the file is located.
